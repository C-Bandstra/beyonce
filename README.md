Progression

## Iteration 0 - Initial Layout & UI
This should be completed by the end of the first day.

Build out views for both the game page and win page (this should all be in a single HTML file)
Build out the HTML for the cards to figure out how to scatter them (see the comp)
BUT! Know that this hardcoded HTML will not be used; the cards will be programmatically created by the JavaScript in a later iteration
Get at least a rough draft of your styling finished.
Iteration 1 - Setting Up the Data Model
So what IS the data model?

In most complex applications, user inputs and moving pieces of information are handled by JavaScript, and stored in complex data types (arrays, objects). Once the data has been updated, then the program uses those arrays and objects to display the new information on the DOM.

This is done for a few reasons:

We never want to show information to the user that is not accurate
For example, if you Liked a tweet on Twitter, and you saw the red heart appear, you would expect that your Like had been saved, and if you refreshed the page, it would still show up
But what if Twitter built their logic to update the DOM first, and then try to save that info?
It would be possible to see a change, but for that change to not be stored anywhere.
We want to avoid that confusing situation!
We are always going to store information in JS objects and arrays FIRST
Then, we‚Äôll display that information on the DOM by iterating over our stored data
Sometimes you will hear this described as separating ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù from ‚Äúdisplay logic‚Äù. It‚Äôs also known as ‚Äúseparation of concerns‚Äù - that is, making sure that we‚Äôre always updating our source of truth and then using it to display information on the DOM.

To do this, we‚Äôre going to create two JavaScript classes: Card and Deck.

Data:
Each card should get its data from an object instance of a Card class
Each card should have a matchInfo property which will hold the same value as the card that matches it. You can determine how to format that matching value. Each card should also have a matched property, a boolean, that will default to false and toggle to true once a match has been made.
Each card should have a method match on it
All card object instances should be held in the Deck class
The Deck should have cards, matchedCards, and selectedCards as properties. The Deck should have the following methods: shuffle, checkSelectedCards, and moveToMatched. If you find a need for additional methods, write/use them!
Create two files: card.js and deck.js
Build out both classes

Consider:
What properties in the class should be dynamic, and which ones should be default?
What will each method do?
If you‚Äôre not sure, look forward to future iterations to see when you might need it - it‚Äôs okay to wait to define the method until you know how you need to use it!

## Iteration 2 - Rendering the Data Model

Iterate over the Deck‚Äôs array of Card object instances to display the cards on the DOM (for now, don‚Äôt worry about scrambling up the cards)
User should see ten cards scattered across the screen, face down
Leave the left-hand sidebar static for now; we will add that functionality in the next iteration
Data model: When a user clicks a card, a copy of that card object instance should be added to the deck‚Äôs selectedCards array
DOM: When a user clicks a card, it should flip over, revealing the image (don‚Äôt worry about finding matches until next iteration)
Data model: When that card is clicked a second time, the copy of that card object instance should be removed from the deck‚Äôs selectedCards array
DOM: When that card is clicked a second time, it should flip to be face down again, showing the back of the card (the ‚ÄúB‚Äù)
Every card should be clickable in this way

## Iteration 3 - Making the game playable
Once again, we‚Äôll leave the sidebar static (we‚Äôll begin updating it in the next iteration)
User should only be able to flip over two cards at a time.
Data model: If the two flipped cards match, the data model should be updated by using the appropriate Deck methods
DOM: If the two flipped cards match, they should disappear from the DOM and the ‚ÄúMatches This Round‚Äù count should increase.
If the cards don‚Äôt match, the user should be able to re-click them to turn them back over.
User should be able to continue playing until all matches have been found
Once all matches are found, the user should see the page with a message congratulating them and telling them how long it took to find all the matches
(The comp shows seconds, but we think minutes and seconds are more friendly to the user!)

## Iteration 4 - Refining gameplay
Now that you‚Äôre getting the hang of using the data model to render things to the DOM, from now on, we‚Äôre only going to give you the DOM functionality, and it‚Äôs up to you to figure out how to update and use the data model to accomplish it!

On the left hand side of the page, the player should see the number of ‚ÄúMatches This Round‚Äù updating as matches are found
If this is not the first round, on the left hand side of the page, the player should see up to three of their best (shortest/fastest) times
Every time a match is found and the cards are removed from the DOM, the photo of the match should appear in the left hand sidebar, replacing one of the gray boxes, to visually show the user which matches have been found
Each time a user plays, the ten cards should be arranged differently - hint: the Deck class should handle this logic
Instead of having to manually re-click a card to turn it back face-down, the program should automatically flip both cards over, after the user has had ___ seconds from the time both cards are revealed to view them. This is a great opportunity to do some user testing and see what the right amount of time is!
Anytime a card flips over, there should be a smooth transition.

## Iteration 5 - Local Storage
The users times should persist in Local Storage
This will allow the user‚Äôs best/shortest/fastest times to be displayed, even if they refresh the browser.

### Iteration 6 - Two Players
Now, we are going to update our game to allow two players to compete against one another. A complete round will consist of two games:

Player 1 will play a complete game and find all the matches.
Instead of showing the win page, a new game will automatically begin for Player 2
When Player 2 finishes their game, the win page will show the winner based on whose time was fastest
Data:
Each player should get its data from an object instance of a Player class
Each player should have a name property and a wins property that defaults to an empty array
Each player should have a saveWin method, which stores their game time in the wins array
If you see the need for other properties or methods, you can absolutely add those!
Here is the desired functionality:

Two users should be able to compete
The players should first see a screen where they enter their names
The players should be able to click the Begin Game button and be taken to the game screen
The left hand sidebar should now also display the current player‚Äôs name
The left hand sidebar should display the top 3 fastest times and the name of the player who earned it (if no game data exists, in that space, display an encouraging phrase instead)
Note: Consider how you will need to update your local storage functionality to be able to display the above data
When a round is over (both players have played one complete game), the winning player and their time appears on the page.
When the game is over, the users can click ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù to start a new game without having to sign in and enter their names again - it should go directly to the game UI
When the game is over, a new button should appear on the winning page that reads ‚ÄúNew Game‚Äù, which returns to the player sign in screen, so two new people can add their names and play
If a user with the same name as someone of the ‚ÄúTop 5 Winners‚Äù board is playing, a trophy-like icon should appear on their side of the scoreboard to indicate that one (or both) of the players is a previous winner.
Extensions
Remember: extensions are not required, and should only be attempted when all previous functionality has been completed, refactored to be DRY/readable/observe SRP, and polished to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience.

The users should have the ability to pause the game. Once it is paused, time stops, and no cards can be clicked/flipped.
Under each users name, the total number of wins they have had should appear. This should persist on page refresh. (Think about how this impacts your data for Player!)
If the user leaves the page and comes back, the game will still be paused, but can resume from there (all cards in same position, same number of ‚Äúmatches‚Äù etc.)
Test your classes (we can provide some assistance with the setup if you‚Äôd like to tackle this!)
Comp
The font used in the comp is Arial.

You may use your own images if you‚Äôre not feeling the Queen (üò±), but don‚Äôt spend more than 30 minutes gathering them.
